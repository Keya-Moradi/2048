1. **Objective:** Reach the 2048 tile by merging tiles of the same number.
2. **Controls:** Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to move tiles.
3. **Merging Tiles:** Tiles with the same number merge into one when they touch. The resulting tileâ€™s value is the sum of the merged tiles.
4. **Game End:** You win by reaching the 2048 tile. The game ends if there are no possible moves left.
